### Project Title

 US Bikeshare Data Project

### Description

This is the second project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program where
bike rideshare data for a few select cities (New York, Chicago, and Washington,
DC) are used to create a terminal application that gives a set of summary
statistics for each city. This is implemented in Python.

## Requirements

`Python 3.x` , `Pandas` and 'Numpy'.

### Files used

This repository contains:

1. Three csv files with data for three cities:
 
 - chicago.csv
 - new_york_city.csv
 - washington.csv

2. One python file written to assess the data in the csv files:

 - bikeshare.py

### Credits

It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.

To complete the project, I used my knowledge which I gained over the course of studying the Python Foundation Nanodegree Program on Udacity.
If I got stuck some place, the source(s) below helped me-
1. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
2. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
3. [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/)
4. [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/)
5. I used [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) extensively for quickly running small snippets of code, and [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) for bigger pieces of code.

To use the project:

1. Place the bikeshare.py file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
2. Run the python file using a suitable python interpreter.
